# Sassy normalize
Normalize. But for sass.

## Configure

There's one variable to set, if wanted.
```
$oldest-supported-ie-version: 9;
```

IE 9 is the default value, as per the newest Normalize version, but if you're supporting dinosaur browsers you can change this value to a lower number.

Feel free to update and change the code to your hearts content.

Have fun.
